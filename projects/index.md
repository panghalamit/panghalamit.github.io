## Personal Projects

### InnerCircle : A decentralized application on ethereum for creating pop-up events
* Developed as part of two-day hackathon organized by Consensys.
* Application developed using React, Solidity and Linnia protocol.
* Creating meaningful engagement similar to word of mouth by allowing anyone to create an event and invite trusted/loyal inner circle of members.
* Referral Mechanism to expand the circle.
* [Try it yourself]({{"https://vutsalsinghal.github.io/linnia-hackathon/"}})
* code is open source and available [here]({{"https://github.com/vutsalsinghal/linnia-hackathon"}})


## Completed @ NYU

### Books2Rec : Book Recommender System For Goodreads
* As part of Big Data Science class by Prof. Anasse Bari.
* Hybrid Recommender System using Latent Factors from Reader-Book interaction and content based features for books metadata.
* Looking for recommendations for books to read, try our [website]({{"https://books2rec.me"}})

### Secure Authentication system for mobile users
* A challenge-response based 2-Factor Authentication system using SMS channel
* Authentication backend in Python django
* Twilio APIs for interaction with mobile device via SMS channel
* Android application to interact with Authentication server   

### Forecasting average speed of buses between MTA Bus Stops
* Analyzed Time Series data of average speeds of buses between two stops among many such Stops
* Data cleaning and Preparation for Missing values in Time Series
* Model identification for each of the Time Series(AR, MA, ARMA ot ARIMA)
* Compared the Forecasting results with Linear Regression
* Spark was used for both Forecasting and Prediction using linear Regression

### Classification of News Articles

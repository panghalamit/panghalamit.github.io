Graduate Student at NYU Courant. Technology Enthusiast. Currently Learning about Big Data Systems, Distributed Systems, Security and Applied Crypotgraphy. Prior to joining graduate program at NYU, I worked at Samsung Research India, Bangalore for 3 years with Communication Research Team. I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2014.
